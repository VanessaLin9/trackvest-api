# Trackvest API - Complete Project Overview

## 🎯 What is Trackvest?

**Trackvest** is an **investment bookkeeping system** with **double-entry accounting** capabilities. It's designed to help users:
- Track investment transactions (buy, sell, dividends, fees)
- Manage multiple accounts (broker, bank, cash)
- Maintain proper accounting records with automatic GL ledger posting
- Organize assets in a global catalog

Think of it as a **personal finance + investment tracking + accounting system** all in one.

## 📊 Core Data Models

### 1. **User** (Users)
- Email, password hash, role (admin/user)
- Owns: Accounts, Tags, GL Accounts, GL Entries

### 2. **Account** (Financial Accounts)
- Types: `broker`, `bank`, `cash`
- Currencies: TWD, USD, JPY, EUR
- Links to GL Account for accounting

### 3. **Asset** (Global Catalog)
- Symbol (unique), name, type (equity/ETF/crypto/cash)
- Base currency
- Shared across all users

### 4. **Transaction** (Investment Transactions)
- Types: `buy`, `sell`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `dividend`, `fee`
- Amount, quantity, price, fee
- Links to Account and Asset
- **Auto-posts to GL Ledger**

### 5. **GL Account** (Chart of Accounts)
- Types: `asset`, `liability`, `equity`, `income`, `expense`
- User-specific (each user has their own chart)
- Can link to regular Account

### 6. **GL Entry** (Journal Entries)
- Date, memo, source
- Links to Transaction (for auto-posting)
- Contains multiple GL Lines

### 7. **GL Line** (Entry Lines)
- Debit or Credit side
- Amount, currency
- Links to GL Account
- **Must balance**: Total debits = Total credits

### 8. **Position** (Holdings)
- Quantity, average cost
- Links Account + Asset
- (Calculation logic not yet implemented)

### 9. **Tag** (Transaction Tags)
- User-specific tags
- Many-to-many with Transactions

## 🔄 How It Works

### Core Flow: Investment Tracking

```
1. User creates Account (broker/bank)
   ↓
2. User adds Asset to catalog (if not exists)
   ↓
3. User records Transaction (buy/sell/dividend)
   ↓
4. System AUTOMATICALLY creates GL Entry
   - Finds appropriate GL accounts
   - Creates balanced entry (debit = credit)
   - Links to transaction
```

### Example: Buy Stock

```
User Action:
POST /transactions
{
  "accountId": "...",
  "assetId": "...",
  "type": "buy",
  "amount": 10000,
  "quantity": 100,
  "price": 100,
  "fee": 5
}

System Automatically:
1. Creates Transaction record
2. Finds Investment GL Account (name contains "投資")
3. Finds Cash GL Account (linked to Account)
4. Creates GL Entry:
   - Debit: Investment Account (10,005)
   - Credit: Cash Account (10,005)
```

## 🛡️ Security & Ownership

### Ownership Model
- **All resources belong to a user**
- Users can only access their own data
- **Admins can access all data** (bypass ownership checks)

### How It Works
1. **User ID Extraction**: `@CurrentUser()` decorator extracts user ID from:
   - Header: `X-User-Id`
   - Query param: `userId`

2. **Ownership Validation**: `OwnershipService` validates:
   - Account ownership
   - Transaction ownership (via account)
   - GL Account ownership
   - GL Entry ownership
   - Tag ownership

3. **Admin Override**: If user is admin, ownership checks are bypassed

### Example:
```typescript
@Get(':id')
async findOne(
  @Param('id') id: string,
  @CurrentUser() userId: string,  // Extracted from header
): Promise<AccountResponseDto> {
  // Service validates ownership automatically
  return this.service.findOne(id, userId)
}
```

## 🔄 Transaction Auto-Posting Logic

When a transaction is created, the system automatically determines the GL accounts and creates a balanced entry:

### Transaction Type → GL Entry Mapping

| Transaction Type | GL Entry |
|-----------------|----------|
| **deposit** | Debit: Cash Account<br>Credit: Equity Account |
| **withdraw** | Debit: Equity Account<br>Credit: Cash Account |
| **buy** | Debit: Investment Account (amount + fee)<br>Credit: Cash Account (amount + fee) |
| **sell** | Debit: Cash Account (proceeds)<br>Credit: Investment Account (cost)<br>Credit/Debit: Realized P&L (if profit/loss) |
| **dividend** | Debit: Cash Account<br>Credit: Dividend Income Account |
| **fee** | Debit: Fee Expense Account<br>Credit: Cash Account |

### GL Account Discovery

The system uses naming conventions to find GL accounts:
- Investment: Name contains "投資" + currency match
- Fee: Name contains "手續費"
- Dividend: Name contains "股利"
- Equity: Name contains "權益"
- P&L: Name contains "已實現損益"

---

## 📖 Key Concepts

### Double-Entry Accounting
- Every transaction affects **at least two accounts**
- **Debit** = Left side (assets/expenses increase)
- **Credit** = Right side (liabilities/equity/income increase)
- **Must Balance**: Total debits = Total credits

### Soft Delete
- Transactions can be marked as deleted without removal
- Preserves audit trail
- Can be restored
- Hard delete available for permanent removal

### Ownership Model
- All resources belong to a user
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins can access all data
- Resources are automatically filtered by user

### Idempotency
- GL entries linked to transactions prevent duplicate postings
- Same transaction won't create multiple GL entries

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Setup Database
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL (Docker)
pnpm db:up

# Run migrations
pnpm prisma:migrate

# Seed data (optional)
pnpm prisma:seed
```

### 2. Start Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Access API
- **API**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Swagger Docs**: `http://localhost:3000/docs`
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:3000/health`

### 4. Test Endpoints
Use Swagger UI at `/docs` or include `X-User-Id` header:
```bash
curl -H "X-User-Id: <user-id>" http://localhost:3000/accounts
```

## 📝 Important Notes

### GL Account Setup
Currently, GL accounts need to be created manually in the database. The system looks for accounts with specific name patterns:
- Investment: Contains "投資" + currency match
- Fee: Contains "手續費"
- Dividend: Contains "股利"
- Equity: Contains "權益"
- P&L: Contains "已實現損益"

### Authentication
Currently uses header-based user ID (`X-User-Id`). JWT authentication is recommended for production.

### Currency Handling
- First version: All lines in a GL entry must use the same currency
- Multi-currency support can be added later

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Investment Tracking
Record buy/sell transactions → Automatic GL posting → Track portfolio

### 2. Cash Management
Record deposits/withdrawals → Automatic GL posting → Track cash flow

### 3. Expense Tracking
Record expenses → Manual GL posting → Track spending

### 4. Income Tracking
Record income → Manual GL posting → Track revenue

### 5. Multi-Account Management
Multiple broker/bank accounts → Track separately → Consolidated reporting

## 💡 Quick Reference

### Common Patterns

**Create Account → Record Transaction → Auto GL Posting**
```typescript
1. POST /accounts { name, type, currency }
2. POST /transactions { accountId, type, amount, ... }
3. System automatically creates GL entry
```

**Manual GL Posting**
```typescript
POST /gl/transfer { fromGlAccountId, toGlAccountId, amount, currency }
POST /gl/expense { payFromGlAccountId, expenseGlAccountId, amount, currency }
POST /gl/income { receiveToGlAccountId, incomeGlAccountId, amount, currency }
```

**Query Transactions**
```typescript
GET /transactions?accountId=...&assetId=...&type=buy&from=...&to=...
```
